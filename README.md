MCPatcher is a simple script for Minecraft Bedrock Edition that allows you to easily add and manage mods from the public community.

## Features

- Patches your Minecraft by replacing the Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll to a modified one so the game is unlocked for free.
- Basically "cracks" your MCBE and unlocks your game without paying.
- You can sign-in, play servers and multiplayer normally.
- Easy to use and lightweight.

## Installation

1. Download the .zip file in the releases.
2. Extract it anywhere.
3. Run the script to replace the .dll file.

## IMPORTANT

- Do not update Windows as it replaces the DLL with the original one.
- Make sure to run it as admin, or it won't work since the DLL is in System32.
## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by submitting issues or pull requests on GitHub.

Enjoy modding your Minecraft Bedrock Edition with MCPatcher!

ALSO, do not make allegations of it being a "virus" or messing up your PC, the batch file is open-source and it just automates the most popular process of cracking.
